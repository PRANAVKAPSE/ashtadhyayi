This is also an _'adhikara'_ or regulating sutra, and is understood in all subsequent aphorisms; or it might also be called a _'paribhasha'_ or interpreting aphorism. That which is called an affix comes after, or is placed after, the 'dhatu' or root, or the _'pratipadika'_ or crude form; as कर्त्तव्यम् and तैतिरीयम्.

The force of the word च 'and' in this _sutra_ is to indicate that the affixes here treated of, are to be placed after a root &c.; not so, however the affixes, may sometimes, be placed in the beginning or the middle of a word.
